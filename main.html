      Hello Everyone,
      Welcome to my Website. I am Anvita Sindhur, and I am getting trained in Bharatanatyam . In this website you will get to know about Bharatanatyam and it's important aspects.<br><br>
      Bharatanatyam one of the oldest classical dance forms of India. It originated in the Southern part of India. The namaskaram is the most important aspect of which is done before and after and Bharatanatyam performance.
      It shows respect to the Guru, the audience and Mother Earth for letting us dance on her. Lord Shiva, or Nataraja is known as the God of this dance form.
      Other prominent aspects of Bharatanatyam are Mudras & Adavus which I have explained below.<br>
      More infromation about Bharatanatyam can be found in my school article linked at the end of the website.

<h2>MUDRAS</h2>
<hr class ="rounded">
<p>
  In Bharatanatyam, approximately fifty-five mudras (hand/finger gestures) are used to clearly communicate specific ideas, 
  events, actions, or creatures in which thirty-two require only one hand, and are classified as 'Asamyukta Hasta', 
  along with twenty-three other primary mudras which require both hands and are classified as 'Samyukta Hasta.

<h2>ADAVUS</h2>
<hr class ="rounded">
<p>
  Adavus form the basic dance moves in Bharatanatyam.
It the inculcation of the basic combination of movement of various parts of the body which is done according to the 'tala'. 
It forms the main component in learning Bharatanatyam. <br>
  For example - Thattadavu: Thatta means to tap and adavu means a step.
  So, Thattadavu is a tapping step.
  There are 16 adavus in Bharatanatyam.

<h2>COSTUME</h2>
<hr class ="rounded">
<p>
  A Bharatanatyam costume is unique and easily identified.  
  Dancers wear saris that are stitched in a very traditional pattern and style.  
  It is very beautiful and colourful. The costume is made out of pure silk saris and looks extremely elegant and regal.

<h2>MAKE-UP & JEWELLERY</h2>
<hr class ="rounded">
<p>
  Bharatanatyam makeup is done with great precision, ensuring it suits the dance form and also the ambience lighting that highlight the makeup. 
  Thus, most artists in this field stick to waterproof and smudge resistant makeup that ensure that dancer looks picture perfect at all times during performance.<br>
  Bharatanatyam dancers wear a unique set of a jeweler, very attractive in the focus. The set of Jeweler called 'Temple Jewelers', such are bangles, earrings, and necklaces. The bun or plait of the hair decorated with a semi-circle of flowers.
